//the dealer eventually spreads five community cards; initially three are down at once, then one each time during a subsequent round to form the board
//during each round, the players in the game use the cards from the boad as well as their own two cards to make the best possible combination of five out of the seven given cards 
//the player clockwise of the dealer makes the "small blind" which is the first bet
//the person clockwise of the small blind makes the "big blind" which is usually twice as much but depends 
//after these two bets are placed, each player receives their two cards from the dealer, and betting action proceeds clockwise around the table with the player immediately clockwise to the big blind
   //In poker betting the action options are “fold”, “check”, “call”, or “raise”, and the specific actions available depend on the action taken by previous players.
   //If no one has made a bet yet in that round, the player may check, which means to decline to bet, or bet.
   //If a player has bet, the player may fold, call, or raise. Folding means giving up your cards, effectively taking yourself out of the game. Calling is matching the highest previous bet made by a player in the round. Raising is to bet but it must be higher than the previous highest bet.
   //

//pre-flop: After receiving their personal cards, betting action proceeds and each player has the option to fold, call, or raise. To participate in the game each player must match the big blind; Betting continues until all players have matched the highest bet placed.

//the flop: The dealer places the first three cards on the board; Betting action begins again, starting with the nearest active player clockwise of the dealer. In this case, the bet does not need to be raised, but it can.



//When betting action concludes, the fourth card is placed on the board. Another round of betting begins. 


//When betting action concludes, the fifth and final card is placed on the board. Another round of betting begins.


//If more than one player remains after the final round of betting, the last person to bet or raise shows their cards. If no one raises the bet in the final round, the player clockwise of the dealer shows their cards first.
//The player with the best five card poker hand wins the pot. If there are identical hands, the pot is split equally. 


//the player with the best hand at the end of the game wins and takes the pot (the accumulated money betted)
